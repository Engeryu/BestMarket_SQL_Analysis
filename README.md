**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 9, 2025
**Author:** [Your Name/Consulting Firm]

## 1. üöÄ Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for a Business Intelligence analysis project to be conducted for Dat'Assur Habitation, a company specializing in residential property insurance for individuals. As a newly onboarded Business Intelligence Analyst, the objective is to support Dat'Assur Habitation's strategic goal of becoming a data-driven organization by analyzing their current insurance contract portfolio. This analysis will provide insights into the current state of tariff standardization, enabling the company to make informed decisions towards a more competitive and transparent pricing policy.

## 2. üè¢ Background and Context

Dat'Assur Habitation's General Manager believes that leveraging data analytics is crucial for differentiating the company from competitors. The aim is to shift towards a "Data-Driven" approach where decision-making is significantly informed by data insights.

Upon commencement of this consulting engagement, a welcome email was received from Pascal Hernandez, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), detailing the initial project scope:

**Email Excerpt 1 (Welcome):**

> **From:** Pascal Hernandez
> **To:** Me
> **Subject:** Welcome
>
> Hello, welcome!
>
> We are delighted to have you join Dat'Assur Habitation.
>
> We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival, as you will be instrumental in helping us achieve our objectives. My name is Pascal, and I am responsible for the technical aspects of our development and innovation strategy.
>
> As you know, our company specializes in residential property insurance: we design and manage insurance contracts for individuals.
>
> The goal of this project is to revise the pricing of our insurance contracts to distinguish ourselves from the competition. We want customers to pay based on their profile, location, whether they are homeowners or tenants, whether they have a house or an apartment, and so on.
>
> Standardizing our pricing policy will enable us to be more competitive by offering a clear price to each customer.
>
> We therefore need your skills to assess the current state of our contracts.
>
> You will find attached an action plan outlining the different stages of your mission, which will allow us to establish an overview of tariff standardization.
>
> Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions!
>
> Good luck with your start!
>
> Pascal - CTO

**Action Plan (Initial Validation Points):**

At this stage of the project, you will validate with your mentor before proceeding further that:

* Your data is loaded into the database.
* The data dictionary is completed with typologies.
* The SQL query aid model is filled.

**Email Excerpt 2 (Project Continuation):**

> **From:** Pascal
> **To:** Me
> **Subject:** Dat‚ÄôAssur Habitation - Project Update
>
> Hello,
>
> Congratulations on this first step, your querying methodology suits us perfectly! We can move on to the next stage!
>
> Now, you could perform:
>
> * The SQL queries to extract the data you need.
> * The remaining analyses we discussed this morning. You will find the minutes of our meeting attached to this email. Now that you are familiar with the process, you are not obliged to follow the model I provided in my previous email, and you can write the SQL queries directly.
> * The submission of the query **results** as well as the **associated query** in a PDF document. Use **aliases** for better readability.
> * The creation of the **presentation** with the description of the **methodology**, the **steps followed**, as well as a summary of the query **results** on a maximum of 10 slides in PDF format.
>
> The objective of this analysis is to allow us to assess the current state of tariff standardization to date so that we can then improve it. We do not expect an in-depth analysis from you. The results of your queries will suffice. However, the presentation of the different steps you have followed will allow us to understand your process.

> Good luck!
